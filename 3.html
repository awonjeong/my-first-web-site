<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. In addition to the text, multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML (HTML 3.2 [HTML32] and HTML 2.0 [RFC1866]), HTML 4 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly World Wide.</p>
<p>HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language</p>
